Using the models
================

Directory structure: cases and runs
-----------------------------------

A case is a directory holding all the data needed to run the model.
Multiple cases may exist next to each other in separate directories. The
model will only work with one case at the time. If no case is
specified when starting the model a default case (default\_sbm or
default\_hbv) is assumed. Within a case the model output (the results)
are stored in a separate directory. This directory is called the run,
indicated with a runId. This structure is indicated in the figure below:

.. digraph:: file_system

   //rankdir=LR;
   size="8,11";
   "Case" -> "inmaps";
   "Case" -> "instate";
   "Case" -> "intbl";
   "Case" -> "intss";
   "Case" -> "outstate";
   "Case" -> "Run";
   "Case" -> "staticmaps";
      "Run" -> " intbl";
      "Run" -> "outmaps";
      "Run" -> " outstate";
      "Run" -> "outsum";
      "Run" -> "runinfo";



If you want to save the results and not overwrite the results from a previous 
run a new runId must be specified.


inmaps
    Directory holding the dynamic input data. Maps of Precipitation,
    potential evapotranspiration and (optionally) temperature in pcraster 
    mapstack format.

instate
    Directory holding the input initial conditions. Can be used to
    hotstart the model. Alternatively the model can start with default
    initial conditions but in that case a long spinup procedure may be
    needed. This is done using the -I command-line option.

intbl
    Directory holding the lookup tables. These hold the model parameters
    specified per landuse/soiltype class. Note that you can use the -i
    option to specify an alternative name (e.g. to support an
    alternative model calibration)

intss
    Directory holding the scalar input timeseries. Scalar input data is
    only assumed if the ScalarInput entry in the ini file is set to 1
    (True).

outstate
    Directory holding the stat variable at the end of the run. These can
    be copied back to the instate directory to have the model start from
    these conditions. These are also saves in the runId/outstate
    directory

run\_default
    The default name for a run. if no runId is given all output data is
    saved in this directory.

staticmaps
    Static maps (DEM, etc) as prepared by the wflow\_prep script.

wflow\_sbm\|hbv.ini
    The default settings file for wflow\_sbm of wflow\_hbv


Running the model
-----------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

In general the model is run from the dos/windows/linux command line.
Based on the system settings you can call the  wFlow\_[sbm|hbv].py file
directly or you need to call python with the script as the first argument
e.g.:

::

    python wflow_sbm.py -C myCase -R calib_run -T 365 -f

In the example above the  wflow\_sbm  model is run using the
information in case myCase storing the results in runId calib\_run. A
total to 365 timesteps is performed and the the model will overwrite
existing output in the calib\_run directory. The default .ini file
wflow\_sbm.ini located in the myCase directory is read at startup.


Command-line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line options for wflow are summarized below, use  wflow 
-h to view them at the command line:

::

    wflow_sbm [-h][-v level][-F runinfofile][-L logfile][-C casename][-R runId]
          [-c configfile][-T last_step][-S first_step][-s seconds][-W][-E][-N][-U discharge]
          [-P parameter multiplication][-X][-f][-I][-i tbl_dir][-x subcatchId][-u updatecols]
          [-p inputparameter multiplication]

::

    -F: if set wflow is expected to be run by FEWS. It will determine
        the timesteps from the runinfo.xml file and save the output initial
        conditions to an alternate location. The runinfo.xml file should be located
        in the inmaps directory of the case.
    -X: save state at the end of the run over the initial conditions at the start        
    -f: Force overwrite of existing results    
    -T: Set last timestep
    -S: Set the start timestep (default = 1)
    -N: No lateral flow, use runoff response function to generate fast runoff
    -s: Set the model timesteps in seconds
    -I: re-initialize the initial model conditions with default
    -i: Set input table directory (default is intbl)
    -x: run for subcatchment only (e.g. -x 1)
    -C: set the name  of the case (directory) to run
    -R: set the name runId within the current case
    -L: set the logfile
    -E: Switch on reinfiltration of overland flow
    -c: name of wflow the configuration file (default: Cassename/wflow_sbm.ini). 
    -h: print usage information
    -W: If set, this flag indicates that an ldd is created for the water level
        for each timestep. If not the water is assumed to flow according to the 
        DEM. Wflow will run a lot slower with this option. Most of the time
        (shallow soil, steep topography) you do not need this option. Also, if you 
        need it you migth actually need another model.
    -U: The argument to this option should be a .tss file with measured discharge in
        [m^3/s] which the program will use to update the internal state to match 
        the measured flow. The number of columns in this file should match the 
        number of gauges.
    -u: list of gauges/columns to use in update. Format:
        -u [1 , 4 ,13]
        The above example uses column 1, 4 and 13
        Note that this also sets the order in which the updating takes place! In
        general specify downstream gauges first.
    -P: set parameter multiply dictionary (e.g: -P 'self.FirstZoneDepth' : 1.2
        to increase self.FirstZoneDepth by 20\%, multiply with 1.2)
    -p: set input parameter (dynamic, e.g. precip) multiply dictionary 
        (e.g: -p 'Precipitation' : 1.2 to increase Precipitation 
        by 20%, multiply with 1.2)    
    -v: set verbosity level

wflow\_sbm\|hbv.ini file
------------------------

The wflow\_sbm\|hbv.ini file holds a number of settings that determine
how the model is operated. The files consists of sections that hold
entries. A section is define using a keyword in square brackets (e.g.
[model]). Variables can be set in each section using a
``keyword = value`` combination (e.g. ``ScalarInput = 1``). The default
settings for the ini file are given in the subsections below.

[model] Options for all models:


ModelSnow=0
    Set to 1 to model snow using a simple degree day model (in that case
    temperature data is needed)

ScalarInput=0
    If set to 0 input maps are needed for each timestep in the inpumaps
    directory., If set to 1 the model will use input timeseries from the
    inputtss directory and interpolate these to maps at run-time.

InterpolationMethod=pol
    Interpolation method when using scalar timeseries input. The method
    can be ``pol`` (Thiessen polygons) or ``inv`` (Inverse Distance).
    The same method is used for all parameters (P. PET, T).

WIMaxScale=0.8
    Scaling for the topographical wetness vs soil depth method

Tslice=1
    Number of timeslices per timestep used in the kinematic wave formula

UpdMaxDist=10000.0
    Maximum distance from the gauge to apply updating to. Only used if
    you force the model with measured discharge

fewsrun=0
    Indicates the model is running from Delft-FEWS or not

Specific options for  wflow\_sbm :

RunoffGenSigmaFunction = 0
    Use subcell runoff generation based on fitting a Sigmoid function to
    percentile Dems. (wflow\_sbm only) 

    
reinit = 0
    If set to 1 (one) the model will not read the saved initial state files
    from the instates directory but start with cold states.
    
OverWriteInit = 0
    If set to one the initial states will be overwritten
    
updating = 0
    Set to 1 to switch on Q updating. 
    
updateFile
    If updating is set to 1 specify a 

sCatch = 0
    If set to another value than 0 the model will only use the specified subcatchment
    
intbl = intbl
    directory from which to read the lookup tables (relative to the case directory)
    
timestepsecs = 86400
    timestep of the model in seconds

Alpha = 60
    Alpha term in the river width estimation function
    
AnnualDischarge = 300
    Average annual discharge at the outlet of the catchment for the river wiidth estimation function.
    
UpdMaxDist = 100
    Maximum distance from the gauge used in updating for which to update the kinematic wave reservoir (in model units, metres or degree lat lon)

waterdem = 0
    if set to 1 the ldd will be recalculated each timestep based on the DEM + the water level
    
reInfilt = 0
    If set to 1 water from the kinamatic wave reservoir can reinfiltrate in the soil


The options below should normally not be needed. Here you can change the location of some of the input maps.


wflow_subcatch=staticmaps/wflow_subcatch.map
	map with the subcatchments
	
wflow_dem=staticmaps/wflow_dem.map
	the digital elevation map
	
wflow_ldd=staticmaps/wflow_ldd.map
	the local drainage network
	
wflow_river=staticmaps/wflow_river.map
	all the cells marked as river
	
wflow_riverlength=staticmaps/wflow_riverlength.map
	the length of the 'river' in each cell
	
wflow_riverlength_fact=staticmaps/wflow_riverlength_fact.map
	factor to multiply the river length with

	landuse map
	
wflow_soil=staticmaps/wflow_soil.map
	soil map
	
wflow_gauges=staticmaps/wflow_gauges.map

	map with locations of the meteorological gauges (only needed if you use scalar timeseries as input)
	
wflow_riverwidth=staticmaps/wflow_riverwidth.map
	map with the width of the river



[defaultfortbl]

RunoffGeneratingGWPerc = 0.1
    Default value for the upper fraction of the groundwater reservoir
    that generates runoff (wflow\_sbm only)



[layout]

sizeinmetres = 0 
    If set to zero the cell-size is given in lat/long (the default),
    otherwise the size is assumed to be in metres.

[outputmaps]

Outputmaps to save per timestep. Valid options for the keys in the 
wFlow\_sbm  model are all variables visible the dynamic section of the
model (see the code). A few useful variables are listed below.

::

    [outputmaps]
    self.Runoff=run
    self.SnowMelt=sno
    self.FirstZoneFlux=fzf
    self.FirstZoneDepth=fir


.. tip:: 
    NB See the wflow.py code for all the available variables as this list
    is incomplete.

The values on the right side of the equal sign can be choosen freely.

Example content:

::

    Self.Runoff=run
    self.FirstZoneFlux=fzf
    self.FirstZoneDepth=fir
     




[outputcsv_0-n]
[outputtss_0-n]

Number of sections to define output timeseries in csv format. Each section
should at lears contain one samplemap item and one or more variables to save.
The samplemap is the map that determines how the timesries are averaged/sampled.
All other items are variabale filename pairs. The filename is given relative 
to the case directory.

Example:

::

    [outputcsv_0]
    samplemap=staticmaps/wflow_subcatch.map
    self.SurfaceRunoffMM=Qsubcatch_avg.csv

    [outputcsv_1]
    samplemap=staticmaps/wflow_gauges.map
    self.SurfaceRunoffMM=Qgauge.csv
    self.WaterLevel=Hgauge.csv

    [outputtss_0]
    samplemap=staticmaps/wflow_landuse.map
    self.SurfaceRunoffMM=Qlu.tss



In the above example the discharge of this model (self.SurfaceRunoffMM) is
saved as an average per subcatchment, a sample at the gauge locations and as 
an average per landuse.


[inputmapstacks]

This section can be used to overwrite the default names of the input mapstacks

Precipitation = /inmaps/P
	timeseries for rainfall

EvapoTranspiration = /inmaps/PET
	potential evapotranspiration
	
Temperature  = /inmaps/TEMP
	temperature time series
	
Inflow = /inmaps/IF
	in/outflow locations (abstractions)
	





Updating using measured data
----------------------------

.. note::

    Updating is only supported in the wflow\_sbm and wflow_hbv models.


If a file (in .tss format) with measured discharge is specified using
the -U command-line option the model will try to update (match) the flow
at the outlet to the measured discharge. In that case the -u option should also be specified
to indicate which of the columns must be used. When updating is switched on the following steps are taken:

-  the difference at the outlet between measured and simulated Q (in mm)
   is determined

-  this difference is added to the unsaturated store for all cells

-  the ratio of measured Q divided by simulated Q at the outlet is used
   to multiply the kinematic wave store with. This ratio is scaled
   according to a maximum distance from the gauge.


Please note the following points when using updating:


- The tss file should have as many columns as there are gauges defined in the model

- The tss file should have enough data points to cover the simulation time

- The -U options should be used to specify which columns to actually use and in which order
  to use them. For example: -u '[1,3,2]' indicates to use column 1,2 and 3 in that order.
