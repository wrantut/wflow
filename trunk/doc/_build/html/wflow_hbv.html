<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model was introduced
back in 1972 by the Swedisch Meteological and Hydrological Institute
(SMHI).  The HBV model is mainly used for runoff simulation
and hydrological forecasting. The model is particularly useful for
catchments where snow fall and snow melt are dominant factors, but
application of the model is by no means restricted to these type of
catchments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="description">
<h2>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model is based on the HBV-96 model. However, the hydrological
routing represent in HBV by a triangular function controlled by the
MAXBAS parameter has been removed. Instead, the kinematic wave function
is used to route the water downstream. All runoff that is generated
in a cell in one of the HBV reservoirs is added to the kinematic wave
reservoir at the end of a timestep. There is no connection between
the different HBV cells within the model. Wherever possible all functions
that describe the distribution of parameters within a subbasin have
been removed as this is not needed in a distributed application/</p>
<p>A catchment is divided into a number of grid cells. For each of the
cells individually, daily runoff is computed through application of
the HBV-96 of the HBV model. The use of the grid cells offers the
possibility to turn the HBV modelling concept, which is originally
lumped, into a distributed model.</p>

<p class="caption">Schematic view of the relevant components of the HBV model</p>
</div>
<p>The figure above shows a schematic view of hydrological response
simulation with the HBV-modelling concept. The land-phase of the hydrological
cycle is represented by three different components: a snow routine,
a soil routine and a runoff response routine. Each component is discussed
separately below.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-snow-routine">
<h3>The snow routine<a class="headerlink" href="#the-snow-routine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Precipitation enters the model via the snow routine. If the air temperature,
<span class="math">T_{a}</span>, is below a user-defined threshold <span class="math">TT (\approx0^{o}C)</span>
precipitation occurs as snowfall, whereas it occurs as rainfall if
<span class="math">T_{a}\geq TT</span>. A another parameter <span class="math">TTI</span> defines how precipitation
can occur partly as rain of snowfall (see the figure below).
If precipitation occurs as snowfall, it is added to the dry snow component
within the snow pack. Otherwise it ends up in the free water reservoir,
which represents the liquid water content of the snow pack. Between
the two components of the snow pack, interactions take place, either
through snow melt (if temperatures are above a threshold <span class="math">TT</span>) or
through snow refreezing (if temperatures are below threshold <span class="math">TT</span>).
The respective rates of snow melt and refreezing are:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{m}  =  cfmax(T_{a}-TT)\;\;;T_{a}&gt;TT

Q_{r}  =  cfmax*cfr(TT-T_{a})\;;T_{a}&lt;TT</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">Q_{m}</span> is the rate of snow melt, <span class="math">Q_{r}</span> is the rate of snow
refreezing, and $cfmax$ and $cfr$ are user defined model parameters
(the melting factor <span class="math">mm/(^{o}C*day)</span> and the refreezing factor
respectively)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The FoCFMAX parameter from the original HBV version is not used. instead
the CFMAX is presumed to be for the landuse per pixel. Normally for
forested pixels the CFMAX is 0.6 {*} CFMAX</p>
</div>
<p>The air temperature, <span class="math">T_{a}</span>, is related to measured daily average
temperatures. In the original HBV-concept, elevation differences within
the catchment are represented through a distribution function (i.e.
a hypsographic curve) which makes the snow module semi-distributed.
In the modified version that is applied here, the temperature, <span class="math">T_{a}</span>,
is represented in a fully distributed manner, which means for each
grid cell the temperature is related to the grid elevation.</p>
<p>The fraction of liquid water in the snow pack (free water) is at most
equal to a user defined fraction, <span class="math">WHC</span>, of the water equivalent
of the dry snow content. If the liquid water concentration exceeds
<span class="math">WHC</span>, either through snow melt or incoming rainfall, the surpluss
water becomes available for infiltration into the soil:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{in}=max\{(SW-WHC*SD);\;0.0\}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">Q_{in}</span> is the volume of water added to the soil module, <span class="math">SW</span>
is the free water content of the snow pack and <span class="math">SD</span> is the dry snow
content of the snow pack.</p>

<p>The snow model als has an optional (experimental) &#8216;mass-wasting&#8217; routine. This transports snow downhill
using the local drainage network. To use it set the variable MassWasting in the model section to 1.</p>

<div class="section" id="potential-evaporation">
<h3>Potential Evaporation<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-evaporation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The original HBV version includes both a multiplication factor for
potential evaporation and a exponential reduction factor for potential
evapotranspiration during rain events. The <span class="math">CEVPF</span> factor is used
to connect potential evapotranspiration per landuse. In the original
version the <span class="math">CEVPFO</span> is used and it is used for forest landuse only.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interception">
<h3>Interception<a class="headerlink" href="#interception" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The parameters <span class="math">ICF0</span> and <span class="math">ICFI</span> introduce interception storage
for forested and non-forested zones respectively in the original model.
Within our application this is replaced by a single $ICF$ parameter
assuming the parameter is set for each grid cell according to the
land-use. In the original application it is not clear if interception
evaporation is subtracted from the potential evaporation. In this
implementation we dos subtract the interception evaporation to ensure
total evaporation does not exceed potential evaporation. From this
storage evaporation equal to the potential rate <span class="math">ET_{p}</span> will occur
as long as water is available, even if it is stored as snow. All water
enters this store first, there is no concept of free throughfall (e.g.
through gaps in the canopy). In the model a running water budget is
kept of the interception store:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The available storage (ICF-Actual storage) is filled with the water
coming from the snow routine (<span class="math">Q_{in}</span>)</li>
<li>Any surplus water now becomes the new <span class="math">Q_{in}</span></li>
<li>Interception evaporation is determined as the minimum of the current
interception storage and the potential evaporation</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<div class="section" id="the-soil-routine">
<h3>The soil routine<a class="headerlink" href="#the-soil-routine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The incoming water from the snow and interception routines, <span class="math">Q_{in}</span>,
is available for infiltration in the soil routine. The soil layer
has a limited capacity, <span class="math">F_{c}</span>, to hold soil water, which means
if <span class="math">F_{c}</span> is exceeded the abundant water cannot infiltrate and,
consequently, becomes directly available for runoff.</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{dr}=max\{(SM+Q_{in}-F_{c});\;0.0\}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">Q_{dr}</span> is the abundant soil water (also referred to as direct
runoff) and <span class="math">SM</span> is the soil moisture content. Consequently, the
net amount of water that infiltrates into the soil, <span class="math">I_{net}</span>, equals:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">I_{net}=Q_{in}-Q_{dr}</span></p>
</div><p>Part of the infiltrating water, <span class="math">I_{net}</span>, will runoff through the
soil layer (seepage). This runoff volume, <span class="math">SP</span>, is related to the
soil moisture content, <span class="math">SM</span>, through the following power relation:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">SP=\left(\frac{SM}{F_{c}}\right)^{\beta}I_{net}\label{eq:SP}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">\beta</span> is an empirically based parameter. Application of this equation
implies that the amount of seepage water increases with
increasing soil moisture content. The fraction of the infiltrating
water which doesn&#8217;t runoff, <span class="math">I_{net}-SP</span>, is added
to the available amount of soil moisture, <span class="math">SM</span>. The <span class="math">\beta</span> parameter
affects the amount of supply to the soil moisture reservoir that is
transferred to the quick response reservoir. Values of <span class="math">\beta</span> vary
generally between 1 and 3. Larger values of <span class="math">\beta</span> reduce runoff
and indicate a higher absorption capacity of the soil (see Figure
ref{fig:HBV-Beta}).</p>

<span class="math">T_{m}</span> is defined as <span class="math">LP*F_{c}\;</span> in which <span class="math">LP</span> is a soil dependent
evaporation factor <span class="math">(LP\leq1)</span>.</p>
<p>In the original model (Berglov, 2009 XX), a correction to <span class="math">Ea</span> is
applied in case of interception. If <span class="math">Ea</span> from the soil moisture storage
plus <span class="math">Ei</span> exceeds <span class="math">ETp - Ei</span> (<span class="math">Ei</span> = interception
evaporation) then the exceeding part is multiplied by a factor (1-ered),
where the parameter ered varies between 0 and 1. This correction is presently not present in the wflow_hbv model.</p>

<h3>The runoff response routine<a class="headerlink" href="#the-runoff-response-routine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The volume of water which becomes available for runoff, <span class="math">S_{dr}+SP</span>,
is transferred to the runoff response routine. In this routine the
runoff delay is simulated through the use of a number of linear reservoirs.</p>
<p>Two linear reservoir are defined to simulate the different runoff
processes: the upper zone (generating quick runoff and interflow)
and the lower zone (generating slow runoff). The available runoff
water from the soil routine (i.e. direct runoff, <span class="math">S_{dr}</span>, and seepage,
<span class="math">SP</span>) in principle ends up in the lower zone, unless the percolation
threshold, <span class="math">PERC</span>, is exceeded, in which case the redundant water
ends up in the upper zone:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">\triangle V_{LZ}  =  min\{PERC;(S_{dr}+SP)\}\\

\triangle V_{UZ}  =  max\{0.0;(S_{dr}+SP-PERC)\}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">V_{UZ}</span> is the content of the upper zone, <span class="math">V_{LZ}</span> is the
content of the lower zone and <span class="math">\triangle</span> means increase
of.</p>
<p>Capillary flow from the upper zone to the soil moisture reservoir
is modeled according to:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{cf}=cflux*(F_{c}-SM)/F_{c}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">cflux</span> is the maximum capilary flux in <span class="math">mm/day</span>.</p>
<p>The Upper zone generates quick runoff <span class="math">(Q_{q})</span> using:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{q}=K*UZ^{(1+alpha)}</span></p>
</div><p>here <span class="math">K</span> is the upper zone recession coefficient, and <span class="math">\alpha</span> determines
the amount of non-linearity. Within HBV-96, the value of <span class="math">K</span> is determined
from three other parameters: <span class="math">\alpha</span>, <span class="math">KHQ</span>, and <span class="math">HQ</span> (mm/day).
The value of <span class="math">HQ</span> represents an outflow rate of the upper zone for
which the recession rate is equal to <span class="math">KHQ</span>. if we define <span class="math">UZ_{HQ}</span> to
be the content of the upper zone at outflow rate <span class="math">HQ</span> we can write
the following equation:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">HQ=K*UZ_{HQ}^{(1+\alpha)}=KHQ*UZ_{HQ}</span></p>
</div><p>If we eliminate <span class="math">UZ_{HQ}</span> we obtain:</p>

<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{LZ}=K_{LZ}*V_{LZ}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">K_{LZ}</span> is the reservoir constant.</p>
<p>The upper zone is also a linear reservoir, but it is slightly more
complicated than the lower zone because it is divided into two zones:
A lower part in which interflow is generated and an upper part in
which quick flow is generated (see Figure ref{fig:upper}).</p>

</div>
<p>If the total water content of the upper zone, <span class="math">V_{UZ}</span>, is lower
than a threshold <span class="math">UZ1</span>, the upper zone only generates interflow.
On the other hand, if <span class="math">V_{UZ}</span> exceeds <span class="math">UZ1</span>, part of the upper
zone water will runoff as quick flow:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q_{i}  =  K_{i}*min\{UZ1;V_{uz}\}

<span class="math">Q_{q}</span> is the amount of generated quick flow in one time step and
<span class="math">K_{i}</span> and <span class="math">K_{q}</span> are reservoir constants for interflow and quick
flow respectively.</p>
<p>The total runoff rate, <span class="math">Q</span>, is equal to the sum of the three different
runoff components:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">Q=Q_{LZ}+Q_{i}+Q_{q}</span></p>
</div><p>The runoff behaviour in the runoff response routine is controlled
by two threshold values <span class="math">P_{m}</span> and <span class="math">UZ1</span> in combination with three
reservoir parameters, <span class="math">K_{LZ}</span>, <span class="math">K_{i}</span> and <span class="math">K_{q}</span>. In order to
represent the differences in delay times between the three runoff
components, the reservoir constants have to meet the following requirement:</p>

<p>Normally the the kinematic wave is continuous throughout the model. By using the
the SubCatchFlowOnly entry in the model section of the ini file all flow is at the
subcatchment only and no flow is transferred from one subcatchment to another. This can be handy
when connecting the result of the model to a water allocation model such as Ribasim.</p>
