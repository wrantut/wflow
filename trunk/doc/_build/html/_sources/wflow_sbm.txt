The wflow_sbm Model
===================


Introduction
------------

The soil part of wflow\_sbm model follows the same concepts as the 
topog\_sbm model. topog\_sbm is specifically designed to similate fast 
runoff processes in small catchments while wflow\_sbm can be applied more
widely. The main differences are:

+ The addition of evapotranspiration losses

+ The addition of a percolary rise

+ Wflow routes water over a D8 network while topog uses an element 
  network based on contour lines and trajectories.

+ The (optional) addition of sub-cell runoff to be able to 
  run on larger grid sizes


The sections below describe the working of the model in more detail.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The \_sbm concept has been developed for small catchments and relatively thin soils. In addition, the numerical
solution of the soil water flow is a simple explicit scheme and the lateral groundwater flow follows topography rather than true
hydraulic head. As such, the following limitation apply:

+ Results for deep soils > 2m may be unrealistic

+ The lateral movement of groundwater may be very wrong in terrain that is not steep

+ The simple numerical solution means that results from a daily timestep model may be very different from those
  with an hourly timestep.



Potential and Reference evaporation
-----------------------------------

The wflow\_sbm model assumes the input to be potential eveporation. In many case the evaporation
will be a refercen evaporation fro a different land cover. In that case you can use the
et_reftopot.tbl file to set the mutiplication per landuse to go from the supplied evaporation
to the potential evaporation for each land cover. By default al is set to 1.0 assuming the eveaporation
to be potential.


Snow
----

The wflow\_sbm model uses the same snow routine as the wflow\_hbv model.

The rainfall interception model
-------------------------------

The analytical (Gash) model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The analytical model of rainfall interception is based on Rutter’s
numerical model . The simplifications that introduced allow the model to
be applied on a daily basis, although a storm-based approach will yield
better results in situations with more than one storm per day . The
amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:

.. math:: 

    P'=\frac{-\overline{R}S}{\overline{E}_{w}}ln\left[1-\frac{\overline{E}_{w}}{\overline{R}}(1-p-p_{t})^{-1}\right]

where :math:`\overline{R}` is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy 
and :math:`\overline{E}_{w}` the average evaporation from the wet canopy
and with the vegetation parameters :math:`S`, :math:`p` and :math:`p_t` as defined
previously. The model uses a series of expressions to calculate the
interception loss during different phases of a storm.
An analytical integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under
saturated canopy conditions is then done for each storm to determine
average values of :math:`\overline{E}_{w}` and :math:`\overline{R}`. 
The total evaporation from the canopy ( the
total interception loss) is calculated as the sum of the components
listed in the table below. Interception losses from the stems are
calculated for days with :math:`P\geq S_{t}/p_{t}` . :math:`p_t` and :math:`S_t` are
small and neglected in the wflow\_sbm model.

Table: Formulation of the components of interception loss  according to Gash:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+


In applying the analytical model, saturated conditions are assumed to
occur when the hourly rainfall exceeds a certain threshold. Often a
threshold of 0.5 mm/hr is used . :math:`\overline{R}` is calculated for all hours when the
rainfall exceeds the threshold to give an estimate of the mean rainfall
rate onto a saturated canopy.

Gash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a
storm basis) the regression coefficient should equal to :math:`\overline{E}_w/\overline{R}`. Assuming that
neither :math:`\overline{E}_w` nor :math:`\overline{R}` vary considerably in time, :math:`\overline{E}_w` can be estimated in this
way from :math:`\overline{R}` in the absence of above-canopy climatic observations .
Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much) higher than
those calculated with the penman-montieth equation .



The modified rutter model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For subdaily timesteps the model uses a simplification of the Rutter model. The simplyfied
model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy into account.

The soil model
--------------

Infiltration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the surface is (partly) saturated the rainfall that falls onto the
saturated area is added to the surface runoff component. Infiltration of
the remaining water is determined as follows:

First the soil infiltration capacity is adjusted in case the soil is
frozen. The remaining storage capacity of the unsaturated store is
determined. The infiltrating water is split is two parts, the part that
fall on compacted areas and the part that fall on non-compacted areas.
First the amount of water that infiltrates in non-compacted areas is
calculated by taking the mimimum of the remaining storage capacity, the
maximum soil infiltration rate and the water on non-compacted areas.
After adding the infiltrated water to the unsaturated store the same is
done for the compacted areas after updating the remaining storage
capacity.



The wflow\_sbm soil water accounting scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A detailed description of the SBM model has been given by [vertessy]_. Briefly:
the soil is considered as a bucket with a certain depth
(:math:`z_{t}`), divided into a saturated store (:math:`S`) and an
unsaturated store (:math:`U`), the magnitudes of which are expressed
in units of depth. The top of the :math:`S` store forms a pseudo-water
table at depth :math:`z_{i}` such that the value of :math:`S` at any
time is given by: 

.. math:: 

    S=(z_{t}-z_{i})(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})

where:

:math:`\theta_{s}` and :math:`\theta_{r}` are the
saturated and residual soil water contents, respectively. 

The unsaturated store (:math:`U`) is subdivided into storage
(:math:`U_{s}`) and deficit (:math:`U_{d}`) which are again
expressed in units of depth:

.. math::

    U_{d}=(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})z_{i}-U

    U_{s}=U-U_{d}


The saturation deficit (:math:`S_{d}`) for the soil profile as a
whole is defined as: 

.. math::

    S_{d}=(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})z_{t}-S


All infiltrating rainfall enters the :math:`U` store first. The
transfer of water from the :math:`U` store to the :math:`S` store
(:math:`st`) is controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity {}
at depth :math:`z_{i}` and the ratio between :math:`U` and
:math:`S_{d}`: 

.. math::

    st=K_{\mathit{sat}}\frac{U_{s}}{S_{d}}

Hence, as the saturation deficit becomes smaller, the rate of the
transfer between the :math:`U` and :math:`S` stores increases.

.. figure:: _images/wflow_soil.png

    Schematisation of the soil within the wflow\_sbm model

Saturated conductivity (:math:`K_{sat}`) declines with soil depth (:math:`z`) in
the model according to: 

.. math::`K_{sat}=K_{0}e^{(-fz)}`

where:

    :math:`K_{0}` is the saturated conductivity at the soil surface and

    :math:`f` is a scaling parameter [:math:`m^{-1}`]

The scaling parameter :math:`f` is defined by:

:math:`f=\frac{\theta_{s}-\theta_{r}}{M}` 

with :math:`\theta_{s}` and :math:`\theta_{r}` as defined
previously and :math:`M` representing a model parameter (expressed in
meters).


Figure: Plot of the relation between depth and conductivity for different values of M

.. plot:: plots/m-plot.py


The :math:`S` store can be drained laterally via subsurface flow
according to: 

:math:`sf=K_{0}\mathit{tan}(\beta)e^{-S_{d}/M}`

where:

    :math:`\beta` is element slope angle [deg.]

    :math:`sf` is the calculated subsurface flow [:math:`m^{2}d^{-1}`]

    :math:`S_{d}` is the saturation deficit defined as:    (:math:`(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})z_{t}-S`)

with :math:`M` and :math:`S_{d}` as defined previously. A schematic
representation of the various hydrological processes and pathways
modelled by SBM (infiltration, exfiltration, Hortonian and saturation
overland flow, subsurface flow) is provided by verstessy (1999).

The original SBM model does not include transpiration or a notion of
capilary rise. In  wflow\_sbm  transpiration is first taken from the
:math:`S` store if the roots reach the water table :math:`z_{i}`. If
the :math:`S` store cannot satisfy the demand the :math:`U` store is
used next. First the number of wet roots is determined (going from 1 to 0) using
an sigmoid function as follows:

.. math::

    WetRoots = 1.0/(1.0 + e^{-SharpNess (WaterTable - RootingDepth)})

Here the sharpness parameter (by default a large negative value, -80000.0) parameter
determines if there is a stepwise output or a more gradual output (default is stepwise). 
WaterTable is the level of the Water table in the gridcell in mm below the 
surface, RootingDepth is the maximum depth of the roots also in mm below the 
surface. For all values of WaterTable smaller that RootingDepth a 
value of 1 is returned if they are
equal a value of 0.5 is returned if the WaterTable is larger than the RootingDepth 
a value of 0 is returned. The returned WetRoots fraction is multiplied
by the potential evaporation (and limited by the available water in saturated zone)
to get the transpiration from the saturated part of the soil.

Figure: Plot showing the fraction of wet roots for different values of c 
for a RootingDepth of 275mm 

.. plot:: plots/s-curve-soil.py



Next the remaining potential evaporation is used to extract water from the 
unsaturated store:

::

    FirstZoneDepth = FirstZoneDepth - ActEvapSat
    RestPotEvap = PotTrans - ActEvapSat
  
    # now try unsat store  
    AvailCap = min(1.0,max (0.0,(WTable - RootingDepth)/(RootingDepth + 1.0)))       
	
    MaxExtr = AvailCap  * UStoreDepth
    ActEvapUStore = min(MaxExtr,RestPotEvap,UStoreDepth)
    UStoreDepth = UStoreDepth - ActEvapUStore
    
    ActEvap = ActEvapSat + ActEvapUStore



Remaining evaporative demand is used to for evaporation of open water. This amount
is subtracted from the water that would otherwise enter the kinematic wave.

Capilary rise is determined using the following approach:
first the :math:`K_{sat}` is determined at the water table
:math:`z_{i}`; next a potential capilary rise is determined from the
minimum of the :math:`K_{sat}`, the actual transpiration taken from
the :math:`U` store, the available water in the :math:`S` store and
the deficit of the :math:`U` store. Finally the potential rise is
scaled using the distance between the roots and the water table using:

    :math:`CS=CSF/(CSF+z_{i}-RT)`

in which :math:`CS` is the scaling factor to multiply the potential
rise with, :math:`CSF` is a model parameter (default = 100, use
CapScale.tbl to set differently) and :math:`RT` the rooting depth. If
the roots reach the water table (:math:`RT>z_{i}`) :math:`CS` is set
to zero thus setting the capilary rise to zero.

#. Water in the saturated store is transferred laterally along the DEM
   using the following steps:

   #. a maximum flux for each cell is determined by determining the {}
      over the saturated part and the available water in each cell

   #. water is routed downslope (using the PCRaster accucapacityflux
      operator) by multiplying the {} by the slope and limiting the flux
      the the maximum determined in the previous step

   #. the program can either use the DEM to route the water or (more
      appropriate in flat areas) the actual slope of the water table.
      The latter option slows down the program considerably

#. surplus water in cells as a result of the previous step is added to
   the kinematic wave reservoir


Lower zone and leakage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the parameter MaxPercolation is set > 0 this is used to transfer water from the bottom of the
FirstZone to a HBV-type groundwater reservoir (LowerZone). The K4 parameter is used to set the
recession rate of the lower zone.

Alternatively a MaxLeage parameter may be set > 0. In that case the water is lost from the FirstZone and
not transferred to the LowerZone.

Soil temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The near surface soil temperature is modelled using a simple equation [Wigmosta]_:

	.. math:: T_s^{t} = T_s^{t-1} + w  (T_a - T_s^{t-1})  

where :math:`T_s^{t}`  is the near-surface soil temperature at time t, :math:`T_a` is air temperature and :math:`w` is a
weighting coefficient determined through calibration (default is 0.1125 for daily timesteps, 0.9 for 3-hourly timesteps)

if T_s < 0 than a K_{sat} reduction factor (default 0.038) is applied. An S-curve (see plot below)
is used to make a smooth transition (a  c-factor of 8 is used).

.. plot:: plots/s-curve-freezingsoil.py


Sub-grid runoff generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sub-grid runoff generaten can be switched on on off in the configuration file. In 
general this feature is used if the grid cell size is relatively larger compared
to the variation of topography. In addition you will need to have information
on the distribution of altitude within a grid-cell. Depending on the topography sub-grid
runoff generation may be useful around 1x1km and larger.

The basis is formed by a sigmoid (:math:`S`) function that is fitted using 
a 10, 50 and 90 percentile  DEM. The :math:`S` function is defined as:

    .. math:: S = 1.0/(b + e^{(-c (X - a))}) 

Where:

    X = input variable (in this case the absolute scaled groundwater level)

    b = 1.0 

    c = sharpness parameter. Higher values give sharper step

    a = centre-point of the curve (normally the 50% DEM)

The :math:`c` parameter is estimated by reversing the function above to:

    .. math:: c = log(1.0/p - 1)/(dem_{p} - dem_{50})

where:

    percentile is the percentile of :math:`dem_{p}`

    :math:`dem_{50}` is the average altitude in the gridcell

    :math:`dem_{p}` is the altitude below with percentile (p) cells of the dem
    are found
    

The outcome of the :math:`S` will range from 0 to 1 for inputs ranging from the 
minimum altitude to the maximum altitude (within the gridcell). Thereore,
the calculated groundwater levels within the cell are scale to match the minimum and 
maximum altitude within the cell using:

.. math:: G_s = (A_{max}-A_{min})/FZT/GWPerc

where:
    
    :math:`G_s` is the scaling factor
    
    :math:`A_{max}` the maximum altitude within the cell

    :math:`A_{min}` the minumum altitude within the cell

    :math:`FZT` the total thickness of the soil in the model

    :math:`GWperc` is a dimensionless parameter (from >0 to 1) that determines which 
    part of the soil profile generates runoff. If it is 1 runoff is generated whenever 
    there is groundwater in the system. If it is 0.1 only the top 10 % of the
    soil profile generated runoff

::

    self.DemMax=readmap(self.Dir + "/staticmaps/wflow_demmax")  
    self.DrainageBase=readmap(self.Dir + "/staticmaps/wflow_demmin")        
    self.CC = min(100.0,-log(1.0/0.1 - 1)/min(-0.1,self.DrainageBase - self.Altitude))
    self.GWScale = (self.DemMax-self.DrainageBase)/self.FirstZoneThickness / self.RunoffGeneratingGWPerc




.. note::

    at present the model uses the drainage base (minimum DEM) and treats this as the 10% percentile
    to which the curve is fitted. So at present only two points are used (10 % and 50%) 

.. warning::

    This is an poorly tested feature

In the dynamic section of the model the absolute groundwater level is determined and 
scaled before it is
fed into the :math:`S` curve function. The result is a estimated saturated fraction within a
the gridcell. The saturated fraction is used to generated Saturation Overland Flow (SOF)
and generate ouflow from the groundwater reservoir:

1. The saturated conductivity for the average groundwaterlevel is determined
2. The available water at the surface is multiplied by the saturated fraction and
   added to the kinematic wave reservoir (SOF)
3. Outflow from the groundwater reservoir is determined using average slope multiplied 
   by the conductivity and the saturated fraction limited by the amount of water 
   in the groundwater reservoir.
 


in dynamic::

        self.AbsoluteGW=self.DemMax-(self.zi*self.GWScale)
        self.SubCellFrac = sCurve(self.AbsoluteGW,c=self.CC,a=self.Altitude+1.0)
        self.SubCellRunoff = self.SubCellFrac * FreeWaterDepth
        self.SubCellGWRunoff = min(self.SubCellFrac * self.FirstZoneDepth,\ 
            self.SubCellFrac * self.Slope * self.FirstZoneKsatVer * \ 
            exp(-self.f * self.zi) * self.timestepsecs/self.basetimestep)
        self.FirstZoneDepth=self.FirstZoneDepth-self.SubCellGWRunoff
        FreeWaterDepth = FreeWaterDepth - self.SubCellRunoff



Kinematic wave and River Width
------------------------------


The river width is determined from the DEM the upstream area and yearly
average discharge ([Finnegan]_):

.. math:

    W = [\alpha (\alpha + 2)^{2/3}]^{3/8} Q^{3/8} S^{-3/16} n^{3/8}

The early average Q at outlet is scaled for each point in the drainage network 
with the upstream area. :math:`\alpha` ranges from 5 to > 60. Here 5 is used for hardrock,
largre values are used for sediments
  

Implementation::

    upstr = catchmenttotal(1, self.TopoLdd)
    Qscale = upstr/mapmaximum(upstr) * Qmax
    W = (alf * (alf + 2.0)**(0.6666666667))**(0.375) * Qscale**(0.375) *\
         (max(0.0001,windowaverage(self.Slope,celllength() * 4.0)))**(-0.1875) *\
         self.N **(0.375)
    RiverWidth = W
 

The table below list commonly used Manning's N values (in the N_River .tbl file). 
Please note that  the values for non river cells may arguably be set 
significantly higher. (Use N.tbl for non-river cells and N_River.tbl for river cells)

Subcatchment flow
=================
Normally the the kinematic wave is continuous throughout the model. By using the
the SubCatchFlowOnly entry in the model section of the ini file all flow is at the
subcatchment only and no flow is transferred from one subcatchment to another. This can be handy
when connecting the result of the model to a water allocation model such as Ribasim.

Example:

::

    [model]
    SubCatchFlowOnly = 1

Dynamic wave
------------

.. warning::

    As of version 0.93 this is moved to the wflow\_wave module.

An *experimental* implementation of the full dynamic wave equations has been 
implemented. The current implementation is fairly unstable and *very* slow.
It can be switched on by setting dynamicwave=1 in the [dynamicwave] 
section of the ini file. See below for an example: 


::

    [dynamicwave]
    # Switch on dynamic wave for main rivers
    dynamicwave=1
    
    # Number of timeslices per dynamic wave substep
    TsliceDyn=100
    
    # number of substeps for the dynamic wave with respect to the model timesteps
    dynsubsteps=24
    
    # map with level boundary points
    wflow_hboun = staticmaps/wflow_outlet.map
    
    # Optional river map for the dynamic wave that must be the same size or smaller as that of the
    # kinematic wave
    wflow_dynriver = staticmaps/wflow_dynriver.map
    
    # a fixed water level for each non-zero point in the wflow_hboun map 
    # level > 0.0 use that level
    # level == 0.0 use supplied timeseries (see levelTss)
    # level < 0.0 use upstream water level
    fixedLevel = 3.0

    # if this is set the program will try to keep the volume at the pits at
    # a constant value
    lowerflowbound = 1
    
    # instead of a fixed level a tss file with levels for each timesteps and each 
    # non-zero value in the wflow_hboun map
    #levelTss=intss/Hboun.tss
    
    # If set to 1 the program will try to optimise the timestep
    # Experimental, mintimestep is the smallest to be used
    #AdaptiveTimeStepping = 1
    #mintimestep =1.0



A description of the implementation of the dynamicwave is given on the 
`pcraster website <http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/documentation/PCRaster/html/op_dynamicwave.html>`_.
 
In addition to the settings in the ini file you need to give the model additional maps
or lookuptables:

- ChannelDepth.[map|tbl] - depth of the main channel in metres
- ChannelRoughness.[map|tbl] - manning roughness coefficient (default = 0.03)
- ChannelForm.[map|tbl] - form of the chnaggel (default = 0.0)
- FloodplainWidth.[map|tbl] - width of the floodplain in metres (default = )

The following variables for the dynamicwave function are set as follows:

- ChannelBottomLevel - Taken from the dem
- ChannelLength - Taken from the length in the kinematic wave
- ChannelBottomWidth - taken from the wflow_riverwidth map (this map can be user supplied 
  or when it is not supplied a geomorphological relation is used)


Becuase the dynamic wave can be unstable priming the model with new initial 
conditions is best done in several steps:

#. Run the model with the -I option and the dynamic wave switch off
#. Copy back the resulting state files to the instate directory
#. Re-run the model with the without the -I option
#. Copy back the resulting states of the Dynamic wave to the instate directory



Model variables stores and fluxes
---------------------------------

The diagram below shows the stores and fluxes in the model in terms of internal variable names. It
onlys shows the soil and Kinematic wave reservoir, not the canopy model.

Processing of meteorological forcing data
-----------------------------------------

Although the model has been setup to do as little data processing
as possible it includes an option to apply an altitude correction to the 
temperature inputs. The three squares below demonstrate the principle.

.. digraph:: grids

	node[shape=record];
	a[label="{5|5|5}|{5|5|5}|{5|5|5}"];
	b[label="{1|2|3}|{4|5|6}|{7|8|9}"];
	c[label="{4|3|2}|{1|0|-1}|{-2|-3|-4}"];
          "Average T input grid" -> a
          "Correction per cell" -> b
          "Resulting T" -> c

wflow\_sbm takes the correction grid as input and applies this to the input
temperature. The correction grid has to be made outside of the model.
The correction grid is optional.

.. note::

	The temperature correction map is specified in the model section of the ini file:

	[model]
	TemperatureCorrectionMap=NameOfTheMap

	If the entry is not in the file the correction will not be applied


Guidelines for wflow\sbm model parameters
