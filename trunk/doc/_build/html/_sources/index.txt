Introduction
============

This document describes the wflow distributed hydrological modelling platform.
wflow is part of the Deltares'
OpenStreams project (http://www.openstreams.nl). Wflow consists of a
set of python programs that can be run on the command line and perform
hydrological simulations. The models are based on the PCRaster python
framework. In wflow this framework is extended (the ``wf_DynamicFramework``
class) so that models build using the framework can be controlled using
the API. Links to OpenMI (www.openmi.org) and OpenDAP (www.openda.org) 
are being tested.

The  wflow distributed hydrological model platform currently includes
the following models:

-  the wflow\_sbm  model (derived from `topog\_sbm <http://www.per.clw.csiro.au/topog/>`_ )

-  the wflow\_hbv model (a distributed version of the HBV96 model).

-  the wflow\_gr4 model (a distributed version of the gr4h/d models).

-  the wflow\_routing model (a kinematic wave model that can run on the output of tone of the hydrological models).

-  the wflow\_wave model (a dynamic wave model that can run on the output of the wflow\_routing model).

-  the wflow\_floodmap model (a flood mapping model that can use the output of the wflow\_wave model or de wflow\_routing model).

The low level api and links to other frameworks allow the models to be
linked as part of larger modelling systems:

.. note::

    wflow is part of the Deltares OpenStreams project
    (http://www.openstreams.nl). The OpenStreams project is a work in
    progress. Wflow functions as a toolkit for distributed hydrological
    models within OpenStreams.

.. warning::

    At the moment the models and documentation are being worked on. Things
    that worked yesterday may stop working tomorrow. 

The different wflow models share the same structure but are fairly
different with respect to the conceptualisation. The shared software
framework includes the basic maps (dem, landuse, soil etc) and the
hydrological routing via the kinematic wave. The Python class framework
also exposes the models as an API and is based on the PCRaster/Python
version 4.0 Beta (www.pcraster.eu).

The wflow\_sbm model maximises the use of available spatial data.
Soil depth, for example, is estimated from the DEM using a topographic
wetness index . The model is derived from the [CQFLOW]_ model that has
been applied in various countries, most notably in Central America. The
wflow\_hbv model is derived from the HBV-96 model but does not
include the routing functions, instead it uses the same kinematic wave
routine as the wflow\_sbm  model to route the water downstream.

The models are programmed in a dynamic GIS language called PCRaster
available as a Python extension. As such, the structure of the model is
transparent, can be changed by other modellers easily, and the system
allows for rapid development. The PCRaster version used here is a beta
version that comes with bindings to the Python language. In order to run
the model both PCRaster and Python 2.7 are needed.
